# GOLANG APIs

Collection of CRUD and REST APIs I've made using golang


The movie db API: 
Lets users add, delete or update movies in the overall database and it also lets them get all the data for the movies or get movie data
for a specific ID. This data includes the id of the movie, the isbn of the movie, the title of the movie, the director and the rating of the movie.
The rating comes from the average overall rating of the movie on letterboxd and that data is webscraped from the site.

The hatchways API: 
Has a ping function that returns if the hatchways blog site API is succesfully reached and it gets posts from that hatchways AP that 
have the same tag as the one the user passed in.
